Tracks AI research + engineering trends for an AI researcher / systems engineer who works with AI daily — generated from [TRENDS.md](TRENDS.md).

**Since last scan (2026-08-24):**

- **A harness that transfers**: [NVIDIA AVO reaches 100% on ARC-AGI-3](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-avo-reaches-100-on-arc-agi-3-demonstrating-a-frontier-level-general-purpose-architecture-for-long-horizon-autonomous-agents/) — the same supervisor+persistent-memory agent architecture NVIDIA built for GPU-kernel optimization, ported unmodified, clears every level → [Agent harness/runtime/memory infra](TRENDS.md#id-agent-runtime-015-agent-harnessruntimememory-as-a-first-class-engineered-self-improving-object) evidence.
- **Security moves into the stack**: NVIDIA formalizes [where security fits in an AI agent stack](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/where-security-fits-in-an-ai-agent-stack/) — a named layered reference model (harness → meta-harness → secure runtime → infra) → [Agent security](TRENDS.md#id-agent-security-004-agent-security-formal-limits-of-prompt-injection-defenses-and-the-architectural-turn) evidence.
- **The spec keeps moving**: MCP publishes [its next roadmap](https://blog.modelcontextprotocol.io/posts/mcp-roadmap/) — agent identity/DPoP, agentic messaging primitives, HTTP-native transport → [MCP standard integration layer](TRENDS.md#id-mcp-standard-001-mcp-as-the-standard-integration-layer-for-agents-stateless-core-apps-tasks) evidence.
- A 3-day catch-up run added 6 evidence lines across 6 trends total (also [SWE-bench Science](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.19799), [OmniScientist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13558)) — no new seed, no stage moves; see the [watchlist](TRENDS.md#observation_queue) for today's queue additions.

## Worth studying

- [NVIDIA AVO Reaches 100% on ARC-AGI-3](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-avo-reaches-100-on-arc-agi-3-demonstrating-a-frontier-level-general-purpose-architecture-for-long-horizon-autonomous-agents/) — a supervisor+persistent-memory agent architecture, built for GPU-kernel optimization, ported unmodified and clears ARC-AGI-3's public set perfectly (183/183 levels) — a concrete case of harness generality from compounding reasoning/feedback, not domain engineering.
- [OmniScientist: An Omni-Modal Omni-Discipline AI Scientist](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13558) — a sharper articulation of what's missing from autonomous-research agents: workflow coverage (hypothesis→code→manuscript) isn't the same as reasoning over the raw spatial/temporal/multi-channel evidence a real scientist would look at directly.
- [Agentic Search](https://mistral.ai/news/agentic-search) — Mistral's replacement for one-shot RAG: five composable tools (search/open/navigate/read/grep) that let a model iteratively refine queries and verify across sources; FinanceBench accuracy 26.7%→86%, latency down 39.6%.
- [EnvHarness: Awakening Static Worlds for Agent Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.19880) — a programmable wrapper layer that reshapes a static training environment's difficulty and task distribution without touching its underlying logic or verifier — the day's top HF-papers item (108 upvotes).
- [How Claude is accelerating protein design and analytical chemistry](https://www.anthropic.com/research/Claude-accelerates-protein-design) — a weeks-long, minimally-supervised protein-binder-design campaign independently wet-lab-verified by Adaptyv Bio and Twist Bioscience; concrete detail on what "autonomous scientific research" looks like today, plus a rare third-party verification methodology.
- [Agent Lightning v1.0: Towards Harnessed Agentic RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.17528) — Microsoft's disaggregated architecture connecting an unmodified agent harness to RL post-training, now independently adopted by four outside training stacks (verl, AReaL, slime, Polar); a concrete pattern for training against a harness you don't want to rewrite per framework.
- [StateM: Reaching 95.3% Raw Accuracy, or a $15 Frontier Run, on Terminal-Bench 2.1 via Harness Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.15089) — persistent harness-level "runbooks" raise a mid-tier model to match a $574 flagship run for $15, transferring unchanged across model versions.
- [turbovec](https://github.com/RyanCodrai/turbovec) — an independent, from-scratch Rust implementation of Google's TurboQuant vector-quantization algorithm: a 31GB corpus compresses to 4GB while beating FAISS FastScan on speed and recall, with full reproducible benchmarks.
- [Wiz Red Agent Finds Its Way Into Snowflake's Internal Jira Due to an AI-Generated GitHub Copilot "Autofix"](https://www.wiz.io/blog/red-agent-snowflake-copilot-cicd-bug) — a rare end-to-end case study of both halves of the AI-security loop: an AI coding assistant's "fix" silently introduced a real vulnerability, then an autonomous AI red-team agent independently found and exploited it five days later.
- [Measuring Autonomous AI Research](https://www.primeintellect.ai/blog/measuring-autonomous-research) — Prime Intellect's 153-run, 18-frontier-model benchmark on the nanoGPT optimizer speedrun, worth studying for the methodology as much as the honest result — none of the runs found a fundamentally new method.
- [State of Open Models: Summer 2026 Observations](https://huggingface.co/blog/state-of-open-models-summer-2026) — Hugging Face's biannual hub-wide data report: China-vs-US release-scale data, which labs skip the small-model on-ramp, and new agent-traffic data (Claude Code vs Codex share of Hub calls).
- [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) — a fully open-source, plugin-architected agent harness from a major lab, source code included: every capability is a swappable plugin, with an append-only session log supporting resume/fork/search/replay.

## Community pulse

_Unverified community sentiment (intake only, never trend evidence); links are to threads/venues, individuals are never named._

- No earthquake today: the Hacker News front page stayed mostly off-axis (parody sites, search tools, forum threads); the strongest on-axis hit (the new MCP roadmap, 241pts) was followed to its primary and routed to evidence.
- A Prime Intellect nanoGPT-speedrun post resurfaced on HN today (127pts) — content-matched against an already-cited primary from 08-14, not a new finding, a reminder that community re-shares of older primaries aren't automatically new evidence.
- YouTube curator channels (code4AI, bycloud, AI Explained) re-degraded again today, one daily cycle after the weekly's own curl-based heal — the block/heal cycle continues to be unstable; deferred to the weekly cadence per the standing rule.
- Broad Reddit pulse stayed blocked end-to-end (standing JSON/JS-shell block); the Hacker News broad-pulse tier carried the load in its place.
- Tooling note: the Tavily (`tvly`) CLI hit its account plan usage limit again today — a 4th consecutive occurrence of an issue already escalated to the curator via push notification at the W34 weekly; the radar continues on built-in web tools with no coverage loss.
